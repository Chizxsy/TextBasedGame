Welcome to Astro. You are about to enter the world of adventure all from your computer's terminal.
Thanks for playing Astro. You are about the begin. Good luck.
Sorry to see you go. The Astro team(charlie) will miss you. :(
The mission is as follows: you and your crew are traveling at warp speed through space when suddenly you collide with an asteroid. Your ship comes to a grinding halt, power cuts and youâ€™re not sure what happened. Once the buy menu opens you will see a number for the choice that corresponds to the item you can buy. To buy the item press the number of the item that you wish to buy. You will have 5 options: 1 through 5. You will proceed with the game if you have spent all your money or if you type "done" into the command line.
